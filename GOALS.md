# Goals for Nashvegas Tech

It is hoped that Nashvegas Tech can become a hub of tech activity for residents and businesses in and around Nashville and the middle Tennessee area.

Some specific areas where we can make steps in that direction are:

## Curation of outside resources
- complile a list of area meetups that deal with various topics within tech
- compile a list of area bloggers and podcasters.  

Both of these help highlight the important contributions of others within our community, while making it easier to others to find them.

## Dialog
Provide a place for tech minded individuals to chat and carry on conversations that relate to tech.
- General introductions
- Looking for Work / Looking to Hire
- advice on various topics:
  - interviewing
  - getting started
  - implementing X technology
- General tech discussions
- different platforms
  - web-based
  - slack (nashvegastech.slack.com)
  - facebook (https://www.facebook.com/nashvegastech/)
  - gitter (https://gitter.im/nashvegastech)
  - need to pick one :)

## Wide bredth of topics
Nashvegas Tech is intended to provide a platform for all manner of tech related topics:
- .Net
- Specific tech: _e.g. Angular/React_
- Architecture
- Testing
- Security
- UX/UI
- Getting started in tech
- Hiring technical people
- Managing tech teams
- and more ...

## Original Content
There are a lot of talented, knowledgeable people in our industry. We need to assist them in sharing that knowledge.  Having the ability for multiple authors to contribute blog posts would allow for people who are not inclined to maintain their own standalone blog to still contribute.

Authors would need to be vetted or somehow approved.

## Built together
Nashvegas Tech is setup as an organization in GitHub.  This is where the Nashvegas Tech communitity can work on projects together.
